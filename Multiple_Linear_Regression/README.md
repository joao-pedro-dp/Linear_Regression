# Productivity Prediction with Multiple Linear Regression

---

## How it Works

- **All math explanations are written in Portuguese**.

- The data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame.

- The multiple linear regression equation is calculated manually using matrix algebra.

- The model computes the coefficients of the equation and allows the user to input their own data to predict productivity.

- A plot displays the actual data, the model’s predictions, and an ideal reference line.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local environment:

         git clone https://github.com/joao-pedro-dp/Linear_Regression/Multiple_Linear_Regression

2. Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

         pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Python script:

         python Multiple_Regression.py

4. Enter the requested input values to predict productivity.

5. View the results in the terminal and check the generated plot.

## Result Visualization

Blue dots represent the model’s predictions.

The red dot indicates the predicted productivity based on user input.

The black dashed line represents the ideal line where prediction = actual value.

## Note

The results are not highly conclusive due to the nature of the dataset, but the main objective performing the calculations was successfully achieved.
