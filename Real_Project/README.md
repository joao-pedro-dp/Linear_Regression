## About the Project

The notebook creation process performs a step-by-step linear regression analysis on preprocessed power plant data. **Comments and code are written in Portuguese**. The focus is on building a predictive model and interpreting the results through visualizations.

The final results archive contains clean, ready-to-use code in english, without comments or distractions.
