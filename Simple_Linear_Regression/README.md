# House Price Prediction with Simple Linear Regression

---

## How It Works

**All math explanations are written in Portuguese**.

The data for area and house prices are stored in a Pandas DataFrame.

The linear regression equation is manually calculated using mathematical formulas for the coefficients.

The model predicts prices and calculates error metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R².

The user can enter the desired data to predict the estimated price.

A graph displays the real data, the regression line, and the errors.
